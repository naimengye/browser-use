# Analysis of Walmart Website's Chinese Character Search Support

After reviewing the test trajectory, I've identified a significant feature limitation in Walmart's website related to international language support.

## Bug Identified

**Character Handling Inconsistency**

- **Steps where issue occurred**: Step 3 → Step 4 in all test runs
- **Nature of issue**: Feature bug (functionality limitation)
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Description**: When the agent searched for "乌龟" (Chinese for turtle) in one test run and "牛奶" (Chinese for milk) in other runs, the website accepted the input in the search box but returned no results for either term, displaying the message "There were no search results for [Chinese characters]".

## Expected vs. Actual Behavior

- **Expected behavior**: A global e-commerce platform like Walmart should either:
  1. Return relevant product results when searching with Chinese terms (ideally showing turtle-related or milk-related products)
  2. Provide automatic translation of the search terms to find equivalent English products
  3. At minimum, suggest alternative searches in English

- **Actual behavior**: The website accepts the Chinese characters and processes them correctly in the URL encoding, but returns zero results with a generic "no results" message without attempting to interpret or translate the query to find semantically relevant products.

## Additional Analysis

1. **Technical support is present but limited**: The website technically supports Chinese character input (accepts the characters, displays them correctly in the search field and results page), but doesn't have a practical implementation for finding relevant products.

2. **No translation capability**: There's no evidence that the search system attempts to translate non-English queries to find equivalent English products. This is a significant limitation for international users.

3. **No intelligent search suggestions**: The system doesn't offer intelligent alternatives or suggestions for foreign language searches beyond a generic "check your spelling or use different keywords" message.

## Recommendations for Fixing the Issue

1. **Implement search translation**: Add automatic translation capabilities to the search functionality that can detect when a user is searching in a non-English language and translate those terms to find equivalent products.

2. **Add multilingual product indexing**: For commonly searched products, include alternate language keywords in the product metadata to improve discoverability.

3. **Enhance "no results" page**: When no direct matches are found for non-English searches, display suggested English terms that might be semantically equivalent (e.g., "Did you mean: turtle?").

4. **Add intelligent search suggestions**: Implement a more robust suggestion system that can offer related English terms when foreign language searches yield no results.

5. **Improve error messaging**: Instead of the generic "check your spelling" message which isn't helpful for intentional non-English searches, provide more specific guidance for international users.

This feature limitation affects users who prefer to search in non-English languages, potentially impacting Walmart's ability to serve international customers or multilingual users in the US.
